    "First I synchronized the axis. The 2014 line is offset from the rest and this gives a skewed image. My first idea was to group the crashes by month and show the lower amount of crashes in front of the bigger number. I was quite pleased with how it looked, but after some feedback it became apparent that no one got the how I visualised it, because it looked like a stacked chart. In this type of chart each different colour block is a separate amount that gets summed up to a total. In my version it was continuous and were the bars merely placed in front of each other. "

    "After that I kept the part of the old version that was good, the bar chart, added the 2014 data in a better way and made some style changes so it is nicer to look at. The feedback was more positive than before and the people I showed the graph to got what it said. The only thing I would change after looking at it again, is moving the Minimum crashes closer to the average and maximum crashes bars if the 2014 data does not exist."
